I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Physics](https://www2.uottawa.ca/faculty-science/physics) at the [University of Ottawa](https://www2.uottawa.ca/en) where I'm a member of the [Computational Nanophotonics](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/lramunno/) group headed by Dr. Lora Ramunno. 

I studied at Louisiana Tech where I received my bachelors degree in 2019 and I received my masters degree from the University of Ottawa in 2021. See my [CV](https://egnorris.github.io/CV/) for more details. 

Research Interests
======
I am interested in the solutions of inverse problems with machine learning and the development of novel computational microscopy techniques. My most recent [project](https://doi.org/10.1364/COSI.2022.CTh3C.5) was the development of a tensorial framework of ptychography for the reconstruction of the second order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor components and am currently working on the development of a convolutional neural network for the prediction of optical scattering by plasmonic nanoparticles.
